To create a snapshot release:

  cd XXX_release_scripts/
  ./mk-release.sh

This will create a zip file

  YYYY_MM_DD_COMMITID_Acumen.zip

The script uses two environmental variables if they are set:
  SBT: command to run sbt
  GIT_COMMIT: commit id to create the release from
  VERSION: Alternative version string

If the commit id is not part of the version string than a git tag
should be created.

For example the special "BSD" release was created using:
  VERSION=14.10.07 GIT_COMMIT=bsd-release ./mk-release.sh
and then 
  git tag rel-14.10.07-BSD

Here is how the script is run on the build server:

  cd XXX_release_scripts
  ./mk-release-clean.sh
  PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/bin:$PATH SBT="java -jar /home/adam/bin/sbt-launch-0.12.2.jar -Dsbt.log.noformat=true" ./mk-release.sh

The script mk-release-clean.sh will remove any old releases still in
the current directory and GIT_COMMIT is provided by the Jenkins build
server.
