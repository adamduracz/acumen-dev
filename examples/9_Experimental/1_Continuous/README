Examples illustrating simulation of continuous systems
------------------------------------------------------

These examples illustrate how we can use an enclosure
based solver to simulate continuous systems. To obtain
good simulation results as fast as possible usually
involves two steps:

  1 Simulate the model with the following parameters
    set to relatively large values:
      - simulator.minSolverStep
      - simulator.minComputationImprovement

  2 Incrementally decrease the parameters until the
    desired enclosure quality is achieved. 

The examples illustrate progressively complex continuous
systems, with parameters set to produce enclosures quickly.
