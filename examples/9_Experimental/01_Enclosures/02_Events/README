Examples illustrating simulation of hybrid systems
--------------------------------------------------

These examples illustrate how we can use an enclosure 
based solver to simulate systems combining continuous 
behavior with discrete events.

 - A system with periodic resets.

 - A system periodically switching between with two modes.

 - A model of a controller, where events correspond to 
   switching a furnace on and off.
