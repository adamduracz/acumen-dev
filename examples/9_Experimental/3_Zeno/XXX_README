Progression of models for the Zeno paper
----------------------------------------

The idea is to show a procedure for studying the
enclosure of systems after their Zeno point, which
goes something like this:

  1 Run the model in its na√Øve formulation, i.e.
    no invariants and with parameter settings that
    make the model fast to run.
    
  2 Add knowledge about the system in terms of 
    invariants in order to improve the precision
    of the enclosure.
  
  3 Tweak the solver/simulator parameters to further
    improve the precision of the enclosure. At this
    stage the enclosure can get right enough to get
    a good picture of how the system behaves before
    and after the Zeno point. I suggest that changing
    simulator parameters is done last because it 
    usually makes the simulation take a lot longer.

I selected the following models to demonstrate the
above procedure:

 - The simplest possible Zeno system. Nicely demonstrates 
   the effect of adding an invariant and the localization 
   time step parameter.

   02_Zeno_Half_Overconstrained.acm
   03_Zeno_Half_Improved_Precision.acm
   
 - A slightly more complicated model, where it already 
   takes some thinking to imagine the post-Zeno behavior. 
   By following the procedure (adding an invariant, 
   tweaking the parameters) we can see that the system is
   not stable after Zeno, which is reasonable if one thinks 
   about it.

 - A system which has stable (even convergent) post-Zeno 
   dynamics. In this case adding a simple invariant is not 
   enough to prove this (the enclosure after Zeno diverges 
   in the first model). Here, in the second model, adding 
   a helper variable and expressing an invariant in terms 
   of it gives a tight enclosure after Zeno.
   I have not been able to confirm it, but the enclosure 
   after Zeno seems to shrink as time progresses, so it is
   possibly another case of a convergent enclosure.

   08_Two_Tanks_Overconstrained_Helper_Variable.acm
  
 - The bouncing ball finally demonstrates the procedure 
   used for the Two Tanks model on a system with a non-
   linear ODE solution. In this case, the convergence after 
   Zeno is fast enough to be clearly visible.
