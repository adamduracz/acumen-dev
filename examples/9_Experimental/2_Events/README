Sequence of examples of Continuous systems
------------------------------------------

These examples illustrate how we can use an enclosure 
based solver to simulate continuous systems. To obtain 
good simulation results as fast as possible usually 
involves two steps:

  1 Simulate the model with the following parameters
    set to relatively large values:
      - simulator.minSolverStep
      - simulator.minComputationImprovement

  2 Incrementally decrease the parameters until the 
    desired enclosure quality is achieved.
