// A box goes wild

class Main(simulator)
private
  t  := 0; // Local time
  t' := 1; // Is as fast as global time
 _3D := []
end
 t' = 1;
 _3D = 
 [["Box",
  [0,0,0],        // Center point
  [0.2,t/2,3-t/4],// Size in [x,y,z] form
  red,
  [0,0,0]]];
end

// Exercises
// 1) Does the box rotate during the animation?
// 2) Display the area of the surface that changes
//    size during the animation
