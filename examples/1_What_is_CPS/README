Examples of Differential Equations

The purpose of this series is to help us get comfortable with
differential equations.  The series starts with x'=1 and goes to
x''=-sin(x).  It stimulates a discussion about how differential
equations model interesting behavior and how they can be solved.
Trivial differential equations can be solved by direct integration.
Linear equations have elegant special form solutions.  Non-linear
equations get a bit more tricky!
