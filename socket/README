Acumen can be run in server mode, in which before running the
simulation, the server waits for a client to connect. After connection
is established, the data of each simulation step is serialized to JSON
and sent to the connected client.  The server continues the simulation
by reading from the client socket, de-serializing the JSON that the
client sends and using it as the current simulation step.

The entry point for the command line version is acumen.Main. Given a
jar file with this entry point, the following command line syntax is
used to start the server:

  java -jar acumen-10-devel.jar <acumen-model-file> listen <port>

A concrete example would be:

  java -jar acumen-10-devel.jar /path/to/model.acm listen 1234

After starting the server, it will block waiting for a client to
connect. Currently there are sample echo clients in Java and OCaml.
