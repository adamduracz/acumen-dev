ACUMEN NOVEMBER 2013 RELEASE NOTES
----------------------------------

Major Changes since the Acumen 2012 preview release (Dec 2012):

 - Improved default ("Traditional") Semantics
   - Repeated assignments to the same variable no longer allowed, and
     now cause simulation fails with an error
   - All discrete assignments are performed simultaneously
   - Derivatives are interpreted in a more direct manner than before
   NOTE: As these semantics changes reject or alter the behavior of
     some old models the original semantics found in Acumen 2012 is 
     also available under under Semantics as "Traditional 2012".
 - A new and integrated user reference manual is found under Help
 - User interface enhancements
 	- Most notably:  File browser, code search, and code completion
 - Improvements to memory utilization
 - Language enhancements
     - A "let" operator has been added to expressions
     - Class names can now be used as values
     - Vector indexing is now supported
 - Enhanced enclosure semantics
     - Transcendental functions ("sin" and "cos")
     - Extended predicate language
     - Improved event localization algorithm
     - New event handling algorithm
 - Various other minor enhancements and fixes

Known issues with this release:

  - Some _3D visualizations flicker when size or color change
    dynamically.
  - The current implementation of _3D is unstable on Linux.

Major changes since Acumen 2010:

 - _3D support based on Yingfu Zeng's Masters thesis
 - Enclosure semantics with support for Zeno systems
 - A more responsive user interface
 - Some improvements to syntax
   - Continuous assignment used to be [=] and is now just =
   - Discrete assignment used to be = and is now :=
 - Syntax highlighting


INSTALLING JAVA 3D
------------------

On Windows you will need to install Java 3D so that you can use the
3D visualization features of Acumen. The instructions below explain
how to get and install Java 3D.

Users of recent version of Mac OS X should already have Java 3D 
installed. However, Java 3D only works with Java version 6. 
If you have newer versions installed, things get quite tricky
and you may need to run Acumen from the command line.
Instructions for re-directing Java to an earlier version can be
found here:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13594864/how-to-revert-to-java-1-6-on-mac-os-x-10-7-5

If you are using fairly modern GNU/Linux distribution installing
openjdk-6, libjava3d, that comes with your distribution will probably
work. However, we have limited experience with running Acumen
on GNU/Linux. 

For a Windows 7 or 8 (64-bit) machine: 

  0. If you have a 32 bit version of Java installed, you need to uninstall that first. 
  1. Download jre-7u7-windows-x64.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7u7-downloads-1836441.html
  2. Download and install java3d-1_5_1-windows-amd64.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR
  3. Follow the instructions about copying the files here

For a Windows 7 (32 bit) machine:

  1. Download and install jre-7u7-windows-i586.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7u7-downloads-1836441.html
  2. Download and install java3d-1_5_1-windows-i586.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR


RUNNING
-------

To run acumen you should be able to run the provided jar file directly.

To run it from the command line something like:

  java -jar acumen-VERSION.jar

SUPPORT
-------

If you can not get acumen started please email help@acumen-language.org
with the following information:

  1) The acumen version you are using (which should be part of the
     name of the jar file).
  2) The name of the OS that you are using (Windows, Mac OS X, etc),
  3) Any specific version information you might have about the OS,
  4) The version of Java that you are using.  To check which version
     of Java you have, please use the website:  http://javatester.org/

If you are having problem with a particular model rather then getting
acumen started than also:

  5) The code you where trying to execute.

We also welcome your feedback on ways to make Acumen better, please
send and bug reports are just general suggestions using the form found
at:

  http://www.acumen-language.org/p/report-bug.html

COMPILING
---------

To compile from source you need to install SBT.  The easiest thing is
to download this file:
  http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch/0.12.0/sbt-launch.jar
and save it to ~/bin/sbt-launch.jar.  Then, create a shell script
called sbt with the following contents
  java -Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=1g -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128m -jar ~/bin/sbt-launch.jar "$@"

Then to compile and run acumen use:

  sbt run

To create a jar file use:

  sbt proguard

which will create a jar file in target/scala-2.9.2/acumen-VERSION.jar
