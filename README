ACUMEN 2012 PREVIEW RELEASE, RELEASE NOTES
------------------------------------------

This is a preview release of exciting things to come in 2013.

New features from the last major Acumen release include.

 - Acumen 3D
 - Enclosure Support
 - A more responsive user interface
 - Exterminate new plotting code
 - Better Syntax for acumen models

As this is only a preview release there are a number of known issues
which we hope to fix in early 2013.

  - Acumen 3D has known problems on Linux platforms
  - The system may not shut down cleanly

For users of Acumen 2010 please note the following important syntax
change:

  - [=] is now =  and
  - =   is now :=

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Users of recent version of Mac OS X should already have all necessary
dependencies installed.

If you are using fairly modern Linux distribution installing
openjdk-6, libjava3d, that comes with your distribution will likely
work fine.

If you are using Windows than follow instructions to get the necessary
requirements to run Acumem with 3D support.

If you are not running Windows 7, or running a windows 7-32 bits

  1. Download and install jre-7u7-windows-i586.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7u7-downloads-1836441.html
  2. Download and install java3d-1_5_1-windows-i586.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR

If you are running a 64-bit windows 7, you need to uninstall your Java
32 bit first (if applicable) then

  1. Download jre-7u7-windows-x64.exe from here
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7u7-downloads-1836441.html
  2. Download and install java3d-1_5_1-windows-amd64.exe from here

RUNNING
-------

To run acumen you should be able to run the provided jar file directly.

To run it from the command line something like:

  java -jar FIXME.jar

Certain version of Mac OS way require the VM argument as a command
line parameter in to avoid performance problems when running on the 3D
tab:
  -Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true

Acumen3D is known to have stability problems on Linux.  If you do not
require 3D support you can disable it by passing the "--disable-3d"
when running the jar file.  For example, from the command line:
  ava -jar FIXME.jar --disable-3d

NEW PLOTTING CODE
-----------------

This preview release ships with experimental plotting code based on
JFreeChart.  However, it has known performance problems, especially
with simulations with lots of data points, so it is disabled by
default.  You can enable it with the "--newplot" command line option.

SUPPORT
-------

FIXME: This is from the original README, needs updating

A graphical user interface should start immediately.  If not, please
contact the project-acumen-l@mailman.rice.edu and include

  1) The name of the OS that you are using (Windows, Mac OS X, etc),
  2) Any specific version information you might have about the OS,
  3) The version of Java that you are using.  To check which version
     of Java you have, please use the website:  http://javatester.org/
